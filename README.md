## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is RSA encryption?
RSA encryption is a widely used method for securing data. It uses a pair of keys‚Äîa public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

### 2. Is my data secure?
Yes, RSA encryption helps ensure that only the intended recipient can read your messages as long as they keep their private key secure.

### 3. Can I run this on Mac?
Absolutely! RSA-Playground is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems.
